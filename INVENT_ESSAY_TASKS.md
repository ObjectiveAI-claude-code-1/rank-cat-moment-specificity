1. Evaluate narrative tension by examining whether the image captures a moment between other moments — whether there is an implied before and after. Look for signs of unresolved action: a cat mid-leap, mid-swat, mid-theft, or frozen in a position that tells you something just happened or is about to happen. Images where the cat is simply sitting, lying down, or staring without any sense of unfolding events should score low on this dimension. The key question is whether the frame feels like a window into a sequence of events or whether it feels like a static, timeless record of a cat merely being present in a space.

2. Evaluate personality revelation by examining whether the image exposes something about this particular cat as an individual — its temperament, its attitude, its character. Look for signs that the cat is not interchangeable: deliberate eye contact during mischief, an expression that conveys a specific disposition, a posture or behavior that feels like it belongs to this cat and no other. Images where any cat could be swapped in without changing the picture should score low on this dimension. The key question is whether the image shows you who is in the frame — a someone with a personality — or merely what is in the frame — a generic cat in a generic pose.

3. Evaluate emotional specificity by examining whether the image provokes a precise, pointed feeling in the viewer rather than a vague, generic response. Look for the capacity to make someone laugh at something particular, gasp at something about to go wrong, or feel the sharp recognition of a shared experience with their own pet. Images that produce only a mild, undifferentiated warmth — a passing "cute" or "aww" — should score low on this dimension. The key question is whether the image carries enough specificity to land with emotional force, the kind that makes someone stop scrolling, lean in, or send the picture to a friend because it made them feel something they want to share.
