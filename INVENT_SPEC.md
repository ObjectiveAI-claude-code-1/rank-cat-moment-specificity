Rank cat pictures by the specificity of the moment captured in each image. Evaluate whether the picture feels like a particular instant in the life of a particular cat, or whether it is a generic snapshot of a cat simply existing in a space. Look for signs that something is happening — that there is a narrative before and after the frame, that the cat is caught in the middle of an action, a reaction, or an experience that reveals its individual personality. A cat knocking a glass off a table with deliberate eye contact, a cat mid-leap between furniture, a cat frozen in the act of stealing food, a cat with one paw raised mid-swat — these images capture specific, unrepeatable moments. Images where the cat could be anywhere, doing anything, at any time should rank lowest — there is no narrative tension, no emotional specificity, no sense that something is happening. The cat is present but not revealed. Images that make you laugh, lean in, or say "that is exactly what my cat does" should rank highest — because they have captured not just a cat, but a moment, and in that moment, a personality.
